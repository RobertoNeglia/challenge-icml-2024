    "A dual matroid of another matroid is where the bases of the dual matroid are the complements of the original matroid's bases.\n",

    "A graphic matroid is a matroid where its bases are the edges that make the maximum spanning trees of the graph $G$.\n",

    "## Bond Matroid\n",
    "A bond matroid is a matroid where its independent sets are the edges that when removed, retain the number of connected components of the graph. One thing is important to note about this matroid: from graph theory, we know that unique duals of nonplanar graphs do not exist, meaning it is harder to analyze the graphs by their (nonunique) duals. However, for a graphic matroid, a unique dual **always** exists, which is a nice property. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphic Curve Matroid\n",
    "The idea now is to use the bond matroids, but there is one problem: the ground set is based on edges, instead of vertices. We can always make a trivial reduction from edges to vertices by means of incidence, however, some natural reductions exist. One of these is called the Graph Curve Matroids, introduced recently by Alheydis Geiger, Kevin KÃ¼hn, and Raluca Vlad.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Graph Curve Matroids $M_g = (V, \\mathcal{I})$, if $A \\subseteq V$:\n",
    "- If $A$ is a cycle, then $A$ is dependent in $M_g$.\n",
    "- If $A$ is acyclic, it is dependent if its removal connects G. It is independent if its removal retains the connectedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above was shown in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, $A \\subseteq V$ is a circuit in $M_g$ if $A$ is a cycle or $A$ is acyclic and its disconnection increases the number of connected components by $1$. In the example of the lifting below, we can see the circuits of $M_g$ are precisely the 3 clusters of nodes.\n",
