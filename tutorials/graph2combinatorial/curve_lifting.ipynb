    "$$\n",
    "In particular, we say that $X$ is **independent** for $X \\in \\mathcal{I}$. The property suggests that there are maximal such sets $B$. We say that $B$ is **base** for $\\mathcal{M}$. We can construct all independent sets from $\\mathcal{B} = \\{B : B \\text{ is a base of } \\mathcal{M}\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tied to any matroid is a *submodular* $\\mathit{rank}_\\mathcal{M}$ function, where if $X \\in \\mathcal{I}$, $\\mathit{rank}(X) = |X|$. The fact that it is submodular is very important, but we leave this distrinction to another setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to modify matroids to be a combinatorial complex, it is enough to:\n",
    "- Remove $\\emptyset$ from $\\mathit{I}$\n",
    "- Set $\\mathcal{rnk}(X) = \\mathcal{rank}_M(X) - 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X \\not\\in \\mathcal{I}$, then $X$ is considered dependent. Similar to bases, dependent-wise minimal sets are called **circuits**. These are also another characterizations of matroids, where any proper subset of circuits are independent in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n",

    "In order to make a Graph Curve Matroid, we need the following (from some graph $G = (V, E)$):\n",
    "- The graphic matroid of the graph $G$: $M(G) = (E, \\mathcal{I})$\n",
    "- Its dual $M^* = M^*(G) = (E, \\mathcal{I}^*)$, the bond matroid, and its rank function: $\\mathit{rank}^*: 2^E \\to \\mathbb{Z}_+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual Matroid\n",
    "A dual matroid of another matroid is where the bases of the dual matroid are the complements of the original matroid's bases. Formally, if $\\mathcal{M} = (S, \\mathcal{B})$, then let $\\mathcal{B}^* = \\{S - B : \\forall B \\in \\mathcal{B}\\}$, so that the dual of the matroid $\\mathcal{M}$ is defined as $\\mathcal{M}^* = (S, \\mathcal{B}^*)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphic Matroid\n",
    "A graphic matroid is a matroid where its bases are the edges that make the maximum spanning trees of the graph $G$. We denote $M(G) = (E, \\mathit{I})$, where $G = (V, E)$ and $I \\in \\mathcal{I}$ if $I$ is a forest/spanning tree of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bond Matroid\n",
    "A bond matroid is a matroid where its independent sets are the edges that when removed, retain the number of connected components of the graph. Formally, if $G = (V, E)$, then let $\\mathcal{M}^*(G) = (E, \\mathcal{I}^*)$. For $X \\subseteq E$, if $X \\in \\mathcal{I}^*$, then the graph induced by removing $X$ from $E$ of $G$ had no more or less connected components. The bases of $\\mathcal{M}^*(G)$ are maximal such sets, its circuits are the minimal sets that do increase the number of connected components. For $X \\subseteq E$, $\\mathit{rank}_{\\mathcal{M}^*(G)}(X)$ is the maximal number of edge deletions from $X$ that do not increase the number as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing is important to note about this matroid: from graph theory, we know that unique duals of nonplanar graphs do not exist, meaning it is harder to analyze the graphs by their (nonunique) duals. However, for a graphic matroid, a unique dual **always** exists, which is a nice property. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphic Curve Matroid\n",
    "The idea now is to use the bond matroids, but there is one problem: the ground set is based on edges, instead of vertices. We can always make a trivial reduction from edges to vertices by means of incidence, however, some natural reductions exist. One of these is called the **Graph Curve Matroids**, introduced recently by Alheydis Geiger, Kevin Kühn, and Raluca Vlad. These matroids are directly related to hyperplanes of graph curves, hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Proposition 2.3): Given $G = (V, E)$, and $M(G)$, its graphic matroid, we can construct the Graph Curve Matroid $M_g = (V, \\mathcal{I})$, where $A \\subseteq V$:\n",
    "- is dependent in $M_g$ iff $\\exists$ nonempty $A' \\subseteq A, \\mathit{rank}_{\\mathcal{M}^*(G)}(A') \\leq |A'|$\n",
    "- is independent in $M_g$ iff $\\forall$ nonempty $A' \\subseteq A, \\mathit{rank}_{\\mathcal{M}^*(G)}(A') > |A'|$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta(A)$ refers to the edges incident to the vertices in $A$. The above was shown in [1]. Admittedly, while well-defined, these definitions are not intuitve. We go into more detail for a double house graph that I added that is used in the paper as a prominent example.\n",
