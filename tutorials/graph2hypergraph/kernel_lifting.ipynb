    "In this section, we will instantiate the lifting we want to apply to the data. In this tutorial, we apply Kernel Lifting. A kernel over a graph is a positive semidefinite matrix describing the node similarity. There were plenty of works on graph kernels [1-4]. Our approach is straightforward: (1) calculate a kernel over the nodes of a graph, (2) calculate a kernel over the features of the graph, (3) combine them, and (4) filter out `fraction` of the closest nodes, (5) if vertices are connected to a given node --- add them as a hyperedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us expand on each step:\n",
    "- (1) Graph kernel can be computed either as Mat\\'ern or heat kernel,\n",
    "- (2) A wide range of kernels can be used to calculate the kernel over features, such as RBF or periodic. In order to \"turn off\" features, use `identity` as a kernel\n",
    "- (3) Kernels can be combined, for instance, via Hadamard product or sum.\n",
    "- (4) We select `fraction`-quantile of values in the kernel to determine the similarity threshold, then we filter out values lower than this threshold and obtain new connectivity based on the kernel,\n",
    "- (5) If vertices remain connected to a given vertex in this new graph, we construct a hyperedge between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernels in the proposed method are the following:\n",
    "$$K(v_i, v_j) = C(K_v(v_i, v_j), K_x(x_i, x_j)),$$\n",
    "Where $K_v$ is a kernel over the nodes of the graph, $K_x$ is a kernel over the features of the graph, and $C$ is a combining function (for instance, Hadamard product or sum). The resulting kernel defines a similarity measure over the graph, and we use this similarity to construct the hyperedges (`1-fraction`-quantile of the closest similarities is used).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that by using identity $K_v = I$ and $C(K_1, K_2) = K_1 \\odot K_2$, the lifting utilizes only features; similarly, it can be used to use only graph structure.\n",
