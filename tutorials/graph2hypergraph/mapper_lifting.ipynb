Use can input their own filter function just check that transform is quantitative. If function is on edges, user may have to specify \"filter type\": (Node, Edge) or position. Filters we construct \"in house\" should just be some projection function (see `gtda.mapper.filter.Projection`).\n",

There is also the spectral distance (smallest nonzero eigenvector of graph laplacian and projects each node corresponding to that eigenvector) and can capture circle data in the graph. Default filter (no atts) can be spectral projection."
