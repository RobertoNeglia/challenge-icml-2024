    Matroids are combinatorial structures that follow certain rules, see the accompanying functions:
    - from_bases
    - from_circuits
    - from_rank
    for more details.
    Moreover, if a set is independent:
    - (1) then its subsets are
    - (2) if there is a bigger independent set, we can construct a new nontrivial independent set by adding an element from the bigger set to the smaller.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ground : Collection
        A collection of ground elements that the matroid is based on. We need this to compute the dual matroid
    independent_sets : Collection, optional
        These are the simplicial complexes that follow (1) and (2).
        If None, then this is considered a dubious matroid, where only the empty set is independent.

    Examples
    --------
    Define the uniform matroid U24:

    >>> ground = range(4)
    >>> independent_sets = [subset for subset in power(ground) if len(subset) <= 2]
    >>> M = CCMatroid.from_bases(ground=ground, independent_sets=independent_sets)
